# Project Expectations
* All students will work on their projects individually (i.e. group submissions are not allowed)
* Proposal, Initial Report, and Final Report must be prepared using <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> or any other LaTeX editor.
* Your peers who review your report should be different from the peers who review your proposal
* Grades of Poster presentation and Final report will be average of (a) grades by the course instructor (b) peer grades, and (c) grades by external visitor/s from industry

# Project Objectives
1. Develop a logistic regression model (for classification) or linear regression model (for regression) for a pre-cleaned tabular dataset with at least a 1000 rows and at least 3 input features (columns) using existing libraries such as Keras and Tensorflow.
1. Implement a Python function that serves as the model.
1. Entend the model to investigate the performance of various feedforward neural network architectures
1. Study, investigate and discuss "what", "how", and "why" your model makes predictions

# Proposal Evaluation Criterion
1. [1 point] Description of the dataset, its source, and motivation for the project
1. [1 point] Visualize/Plot the distribution of each input features and discuss the range of the values (min, max, mean, median, etc.)
1. [1 point] Discussion of the distribution of the output labels
    - In case of classification, check if the data is imbalanced
    - In case of regression, check if the values are uniformly distributed or not
1. [1 point] Discussion of how the data will be normalized
1. [1 point] Discussion of how the data will be split to training, validation, and test sets
1. [1 point] Discussion of what kinds of neural network architectures will be tested
1. [1 point] Discussion of how neural network models will be selected
1. [1 point] Discussion of how predictions on the test set will be evaluated
1. [1 point] Discussion of the performance of the models will be improved
1. [1 point] Effort to document all the steps above in Overleaf

# Report Evaluation Criterion
1. [2 points] Effort to study the importance of each input feature (data analysis)
    - For example, plot each input feature against output and document your findings
1. [2 points] Effort to compare the results of the neural network with a linear regression or logistic regression model?
    - Start with a basic model and then grow your model into a multi-layered model
    - Document your performance comparison
1. [2 points] Effort to study performance difference when linear activation is used instead of sigmoid (and vice versa)?
   - How does your performance change when linear activations are used instead of sigmoid, in the last neuron and all other neurons.
1. [2 points] Effort to evaluate your predictions (using Precision, Recall, MAE, MSE, etc.)
1. [2 points] Effort to code a function that represents your model
   - After your model is trained, read all the weights, and build your own function/method that serves as the model
   - Verify that predictions you obtain are same as the one you obtained using your trained model
1. [2 points] Effort to study feature importance
1. [2 points] Effort to reduce input features
1. [2 points] Effort to develop a 'reproducible' code
   - Someone else must be able to reproduce all your results
1. [2 points] Effort to document the challenges faced during the project
1. [2 points] Effort to document all the steps above in Overleaf
