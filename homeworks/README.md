# Homework Expectations  
* Homeworks need to be submitted through Canvas
* All programming homeworks must be completed in Python programming language
* You are strongly encouraged to use online compilers such as Google Colab (Jupyter Notebooks) or https://repl.it/
* You are responsible for submitting a program that "RUNS"; You will automatically receive a 0 or very low points for a submission that does not run
* All programming homework submissions must include a screenshot of the output; submissions without screenshot may receive a 0
